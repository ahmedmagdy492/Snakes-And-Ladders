VS Computer:
-Turn is determined (say for example player 1)
-all buttons are now available for player 1
-player 1 will roll the dice
-a number will be shown
-player1 marker will move what ever many steps the dice has rolled:
    -the move will take into consideration the spaces between each cell
    -if a cell has the 2 players, the two players will be aligned in a way to make both of them visable
    -the player object has to be updated with the current cel no
    -after the movement is done, we have to check if this specific cell has a snake if so we need to move it down or a ladder we have to move it up
    -if the player reaches the cell no 200 he will win and the game has to reset
-afterwards the turn is going to be changed to the other player

-cellNo
-hasSnake
-hasLadder
-ladderEndCellNo (-1 if none)
-snakeEndCellNo (-1 if none)
